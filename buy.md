The *Windows installer* distribution of the program installs the JRE for you along with the program executable. Despite the larger file size, **the Windows installer distribution is the recommended distribution to install and run Stipple Effect on Windows**.

The *Cross-Platform Build* distribution will require a separate one-time installation of the JRE. You can find the right version for your machine [on Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).
